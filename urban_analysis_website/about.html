						<h2>Context</h2>

						<span class="image fit"><img src="images/graph.png" alt="Figure 5" /></span>
						<p class="caption">Persons who volunteered in the last 12 months, Participation in voluntary work by age group from abs.gov.au</p>
						<ul>
						<li>Of the 600,000 not for profit organisations in Australia only 60,000 have paid staff (10%)</li>
						<li>20% of people over 18yrs of age informally volunteered people with disabilities etc.</li>
						<li>743 million hours to the community across diverse activities</li>
						<li>128 hours per volunteer in the last 12 months.</li>
						</ul>

						<h2>What is the data set?</h2>
						<p>The dataset G-19; is the Voluntary Work by Age by Sex in the 2016 census, counted from persons aged 15 years and over.</p>
						<h2>Why is the data set colllected?</h2>
						<p>The data collected is essential for determining the economic value associated with volunteer work. ‘Formal Volunteering’ was said to be worth 25.4 billion AUD (excluding travel) to the Australian economy in 2010. It also determines the social standards that communities inherit through other aspects of community service such as the satisfaction individuals have with their current state of life.</p>
						<h2>Which government departmet do you think would use this data?</h2>
						<p>The Australian Government Department of employment would use the data as legislated in the Fair Work Act (FWA). Furthermore, the Australian Government, Department of Employment website lists positions available for people seeking employment as a volunteer.</p>
						<h2>Which private sector do you think would use this data?</h2>
						<p>The ACNC or Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission would use this data as it would provide them with information to build on the Australian Charities Reports. This is clearly depicted via the Australian Charities websites advertisements and promotion of charity work throughout Australia.</p>
						<h2>How would this dataset change the way you think about space?</h2>
						<p>The data set alters how space is perceived through the clear depiction of precincts in New South Wales (NSW) were voluntary work occurs. The data delineates the generosity of areas in Sydney, defining the mentality of precincts located around Sydney. The data defines areas such as Sydney’s CBD, Greenwich, Wollstonecraft, Waverton and North Sydney to be the least generous in the North Shore. Whilst, also highlighting the higher levels of voluntary work that occur in the West of Sydney.</p>
						<h2>How does it relate to the latte line?</h2>
						<p>A latte line: The divide between the ‘have’ communities and the ‘have not’ communities. The hypothetical boundary is drawn through Parramatta, Sydney’s Airport and down through Maroubra. The data concerning voluntary work relates to the latte line as it clearly shows how a majority of areas above the latte line (such as Surry Hills, North Sydney and Sydney’s CBD) participate in almost no voluntary work. Whereas areas below the latte line and west of the Airport participate on average far more than people above.</p>
						<h2>How has the data set changed over time?</h2>
						<p>The dataset has changed dramatically as more people are now engaging with voluntary opportunities within their communities. This is evident as it has seen an AUD growth of 6 billion dollars in 4 years.</p>
						<h2>How does this data set change across sydney?</h2>
						<p>The dataset has changed dramatically as more people are now engaging with voluntary opportunities within their communities. This is evident as it has seen an AUD growth of 6 billion dollars in 4 years.</p>
						<h2>How is this dataset significate to peoples lives?</h2>
						<p>This dataset could be deemed significant to people’s lives as it demonstrates areas that are far more generous than others, and as a result, could generate a respected and happier environment for residents. Hence, make it a desirable place to live. It also shows communities that rely on or are in need of voluntary work.</p>
						<h2>Would it be good for this data to change? If you wanted to change it, why would you change it?</h2>
						<p>We would change the dataset to give an average number for each suburb, instead of dividing it. Such as, giving suburbs a total average number just to make it easier to read and define entire precincts and their contributions to voluntary work. This would also allow for direct comparisons between neighbouring suburbs and suburbs above and below the latte line.</p>
